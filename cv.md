## Summary:
My goal is to become qualified enough to work as Software Engineer. Improve my skills and gain some knowledge in order to build an outstanding career. I have been always interested in learning new things and creating a cool stuff. 

## Skills:
System & Business Analysis, SQL, little bit of Python and JS.

## Code examples:
Most of my works was related to SQL. Developed some stored procedures and set several integrations betweens systems. 

## Experience:
I've been working as System Analyst mostly in the past 5 years. So recently, I realized that I enjoy some type of tasks more, something like solving difficult tasks while creating something in order to help people. That's why I decided to pursue the path of Software Developer, since they challenge such tasks every day. 

## Education:
Graduated from Kazakh National University on specialty: "Mathematical and Computer Modeling". Participated in many courses from Coursera, EdX and right now in RS School Front End Development.

## English:
My current level of English is probably C1. But I am learning every day and want to become as proficient as possible.
